# Conways-Game-of-Life
This is a basic version of Conways Game of life which usesfinite, toroidal 2d arrays. This cellular automaton although simple in rules, can create complex "organisms" given the correct initial conditions. 

To run this, download the respective files, put them in the same folder and then run the html file using chrome, firefox or IE. Although the page isn't actually online, it responds to the JS code and user input therefore making it runnable. You can click on the grid squares to add cells!
