            Rules of Conway's game of life as follows:
            1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
            2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
            3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
            4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

            I have made the grid clickable, so please press stop and click cells to make them alive and then start again to experiment with your own shapes
